INSPIRATION
In today's world, social media plays an extremely important role in evaluating businesses/products and customer/user experience. Due to presence of many different decentralized social media platforms, the strategic importance of social data as a whole may not be readily apparent or widely acknowledged, but that doesn’t mean that an integrated solution can’t be found.

WHAT IT DOES
socialTrends collects data from major social media platforms (facebook, twitter, reddit) and provides a one-stop-solution to key insights and trends using interactive visualizations. All the user has to do is plug in a keyword of interest and socialTrends will come up with user sentiments, most occurring word groups, and other metrics across the mentioned social media to help gain an integrated and holistic view of keyword trends.

HOW WE BUILT IT
We used APIs for facebook, twitter, reddit to collect their data and store all of it at one central repository. We then analyzed this data using python by performing exploratory text mining, sentiment analysis and word clustering.
